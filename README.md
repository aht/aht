### Hi there 👋

😄 I'm a engineering & data science leader with 10+ years of experience and 7+ granted patents. I built innovative tools to democratize data science for enterprise at Arimo (a startup named top data science by FastCompany) and at Panasonic.

🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on SWE/ML/data for social good

🌱 I’m currently learning about real-time data architecture, AI/tech ethics, EV/battery, sustainability

😄 Pronouns: he/him

💬 How to reach me: [@climate_dad](twitter.com/climate_dad)

💬 Ask me about AI/ML/dataviz & distributed system

🔭 Recently, I built an automated deep learning (AutoML) system for time-series & IoT data, which can train/tune DL models on ~1B data points, internally used at Panasonic.

🔭 At Arimo, I built an "Alexa for big data analytics" system which can answer questions & visualize large datasets https://youtu.be/3RQDQApgz-4?t=225 (demo ~ 3:45) using Apache Spark, NLP & statistical graphics best practice & d3.js.

🔭 I’m currently working on anomaly detection for IoT cybersecurity & predictive maintenance of industrial equipments and improving automotive experience e.g. detect & improve distracted driving behavior.

🤾‍ Played with distributed deep learning https://github.com/adatao/tensorspark before Horovod, Ray or tf.distributed comes around. I was not a principal instigator in this project but I provided support & optimization.

🤾‍ I contributed to Golang in the early days, like 10 years ago :). I wrote an efficient sieve of Eratosthenes using CSP channels that Rob Pike wants to keep as a demo/test use case as it's quite an interesting concurrent system https://github.com/aht/gosieve. Wrote a blog post about this which is no longer live and I need to revive.

🤾‍ Some Python hacking back in the days while I had lots of free time (fork-exec and pipe with I/O redirection)[https://github.com/aht/extproc], (Lazily-evaluated, parallelizable Python pipeline)[https://github.com/aht/stream.py], (Agents and functions that modify Python sequences in-place)[https://github.com/aht/listagent]

🤾‍ I wrote a toy LISP interpreter that support prefix/postfix & infix op just to annoy LISP people https://github.com/aht/olisp

🤾‍ An esoteric programming gem: (a self-hosting Fractran interpreter in 84 fractions)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1749905/code-golf-fractran/1802570#1802570]. This was one of those things for which the space available is really too small to explain everything...

🌱 I gave talk on ("Visualization as Data and Data as Visualization")[https://youtu.be/3_bTUsqtfHQ] at Strata Hadoop World 2016. As a father of a little girl, I dived into a data-driven story about women stopping coding since the 80s and imagined a world where data & visualizations are easily sharable & infinitely collaborative.

🌱 I gave a talk on "Concurrent programming with Go" circa 2011

🌱 I gave a talk on "whatis git" the stupid content tracker http://aht.github.io/whatisgit/#/cover circa 2012
