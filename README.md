### Hi there 👋

😄 I'm a software engineere & data scientist. I built innovative tools to democratize data science for enterprise at Arimo (a top-ranked data science per FastCompany) and now at Panasonic.

💬 Ask me about DL/ML/dataviz & distributed system

🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on SWE/ML/data for social good

🌱 I’m currently learning about real-time data architecture, AI/tech ethics, EV/battery, sustainability

💬 How to reach me: [@climate_dad](twitter.com/climate_dad)

😄 Pronouns: he/him

🔭 At Panasonic, I built an automated deep learning (AutoML) system for time-series & IoT data, which can train/tune DL models on ~1B data points. Helps data scientists train/tune LSTM, ResNet, Self-Normalizing Networks & Mixture Density Network on data from S3/Parquet with zero sweats :)

🔭 At Arimo, I built an "Alexa for big data analytics" system which can answer questions & visualize large datasets https://youtu.be/3RQDQApgz-4?t=225 (demo ~ 3:45) using Apache Spark, NLP & statistical graphics best practice & d3.js.

🤾‍ Played with distributed deep learning https://github.com/adatao/tensorspark before Horovod, Ray or tf.distributed comes around. I was not a principal instigator in this project but I provided support & optimization.

🤾‍ I contributed to Golang in the early days, like 10 years ago :). It's an efficient sieve of Eratosthenes using CSP channels that Rob Pike wants to keep as a demo/test use case in the main source code as it's quite an interesting concurrent system https://github.com/aht/gosieve.

🤾‍ Some Python hacking back in the days while I had lots of free time [fork-exec and pipe with I/O redirection](https://github.com/aht/extproc), [Lazily-evaluated, parallelizable Python pipeline](https://github.com/aht/stream.py), [Agents and functions that modify Python sequences in-place](https://github.com/aht/listagent)

🤾‍ I wrote a toy LISP interpreter that support prefix/postfix & infix op just to annoy LISP people https://github.com/aht/olisp

🤾‍ An esoteric programming gem: [a self-hosting Fractran interpreter in 84 fractions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1749905/code-golf-fractran/1802570#1802570). This was one of those things for which the space available is really too small to explain everything...

🌱 I gave talk on ["Visualization as Data and Data as Visualization"](https://youtu.be/3_bTUsqtfHQ) at Strata Hadoop World 2016. As a father of a little girl, I dived into a data-driven story about women stopping coding since the 80s and imagined a world where data & visualizations are easily sharable & infinitely collaborative.

🌱 I gave a talk on ["Concurrent programming with Go"](http://aht.github.io/barcamp2011-gonuts/#1) circa 2011

🌱 I gave a talk on ["whatis git" the stupid content tracker](http://aht.github.io/whatisgit/#/cover )circa 2012
