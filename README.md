### Hi there 👋

- 😄 I'm a engineering & data science leader with 10+ years of experience and 7+ granted patents. I built innovative tools to democratize data science for enterprise at Arimo (a startup named top data science by FastCompany) and at Panasonic.
- 🔭 Recently, I built an automated deep learning (AutoML) system for time-series & IoT data, which can train/tune DL models on ~1B data points, internally used at Panasonic.
- 💬 I built an "Alexa for big data analytics" system which can answer questions & visualize large datasets https://youtu.be/3RQDQApgz-4?t=225 (demo ~ 3:45) using Apache Spark, NLP & statistical graphics best practice & d3.js.
- 🤖 I’m currently working on anomaly detection for IoT cybersecurity & predictive maintenance of industrial equipments and improving automotive experience e.g. detect & improve distracted driving behavior.
- 🤾‍I recently contributed to https://github.com/adatao/tensorspark, distributed deep learning before Horovod, Ray or tf.distributed comes around. I was not a principal instigator in this project but I provided support & optimization.
- 📖 I contributed to Golang in the early days, like 10 years ago :). I wrote an efficient sieve of Eratosthenes using CSP channels that Rob Pike wants to keep as a demo/test use case as it's quite an interesting concurrent system https://github.com/aht/gosieve. Wrote a blog post about this which is no longer live and I need to revive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about real-time data architecture, AI/tech ethics, EV/battery, sustainability
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on SWE/ML/data for social good
